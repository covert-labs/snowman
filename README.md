This project focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks for the identification of malicious URLs and the presence of Domain Generation Algorithms. The modeling work is largely inspired by
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08568
  * https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01969 

Further, the resulting models are deployed through a REST API for the use of the general public.
